# P---RegistrationForm
Registration form using local storage
<br>
##In this Registration Form I have used following things : 
<br>
1 => How to use localStorage methods<br>
2 => How to use splice method to delete the user data<br>
3 => How to use the JSON methods<br>
4 => How to use the event listener <br>
5 => How to create the form<br>
6 => How to create the tooltip using the html and css<br>

<br>

##Working :

<br>

1 => The user enter the details<br>
2 => The user clicks the Submit button<br>
3 => If the user email or phone number already exists then the user will get the alert stating the email or phoneno already exists<br>
4 => Else the user data will be added to the local storage and will be display immediately after pressing the submit button without page reload and the entries in the form fields will be removed<br>
5 => If the user want to delete a particular entry then he can using the cross sign in the entry box <br>
6 => If the use want to delete all the entries then he can click on the clear All Button and all the entries will be deleted from the local storage and all the entries will be removed from the web page<br>
